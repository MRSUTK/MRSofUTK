        <h2>Science as Art 2023-2024</h2>
        <p>The Science as Art Competition is an annual event where ndergraduate and graduate students from STEM departments to contribute artistic presentations of their science. The submissions are judged by a pannel of science and art professors, and the submissions of the finalists are displayed in Hidges for public viewing. In the 2024-2025 school year, this event will occur sometime in the spring.<p>
